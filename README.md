# 🛒 Walmart Sales Data Exploration with SQL

Hey there! 👋 In this project, I worked on analyzing Walmart's sales dataset using SQL to answer some interesting business questions. The idea was to explore the data, understand customer behavior, sales patterns, and other insights that can help improve business decisions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains details about:
- Customer types
- Payment methods
- Gender distribution
- Sales and total amounts
- Customer ratings
- Time and day information
- Branch-wise sales breakdown

## 🛠️ What I Did
Using SQL queries, I explored different aspects of the dataset:
✅ Found unique customer types and payment methods  
✅ Analyzed which customer type contributes most to sales  
✅ Gender distribution overall and per branch  
✅ Found out when customers give the most ratings (by time of day and branch)  
✅ Analyzed average ratings by day of the week and per branch  

## 💡 Sample Business Questions I Solved:
- What is the most common customer type?  
- Which customer type buys the most?  
- What is the gender distribution across branches?  
- Which time of the day do customers give most ratings?  
- Which day of the week gets the best average ratings overall and per branch?  

## ⚡ Tools & Skills Used:
- SQL (for querying and analysis)  
- Data exploration and aggregation techniques  
- Business understanding through data
