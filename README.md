# üõí Walmart Sales Data Exploration with SQL

Hey there! üëã In this project, I explored Walmart's sales dataset using SQL to uncover business insights and answer real-world questions. This dataset simulates retail transactions across different branches and cities, helping me practice SQL skills for business analysis.

---

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains:
- Branch and City details
- Customer type and Gender
- Product lines and sales amounts
- Payment methods
- Ratings
- Date, Time of purchase
- Revenue, Tax, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), Gross Profit, etc.

The table structure looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales(
    invoice_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    branch VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    customer_type VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    product_line VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    tax_pct FLOAT(6,4) NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(12, 4) NOT NULL,
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    payment VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    cogs DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    gross_margin_pct FLOAT(11,9),
    gross_income DECIMAL(12, 4),
    rating FLOAT(2, 1)
);
```

## üíµ Revenue & Profit Calculations

Key formulas used in the analysis:

```
COGS = unit_price * quantity  
VAT = 5% * COGS  
Total (Gross Sales) = VAT + COGS  
Gross Profit = Total - COGS  
Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Total Revenue  
```

**Example Calculation:**

Given:  
- Unit Price = 45.79  
- Quantity = 7  

**Calculations:**  
- COGS = 45.79 √ó 7 = 320.53  
- VAT = 5% √ó 320.53 = 16.0265  
- Total = 320.53 + 16.0265 = 336.5565  
- Gross Margin % ‚âà (16.0265 / 336.5565) √ó 100 = 4.76%
